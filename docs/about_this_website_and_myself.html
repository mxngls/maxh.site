        <h2 id="exposing-yourself">Exposing yourself</h2>
        <p>As the discerning reader may have already noticed while
        skimming the ‘About’ page, I took considerable time
        contemplating the decision to create and share this website. Not
        because its development is particularly difficult, but rather
        due to my apprehension about exposing myself like this.</p>
        <p>When meeting people face-to-face, I am quite outgoing, even
        when meeting them for the first time. However, this extroverted
        demeanor doesn’t seamlessly translate to my online presence. I
        have never been one to feel compelled to share much of myself
        with others online. This was true during middle school when
        everyone spent their evenings chatting via ICQ, and it still
        holds true today. For instance, I used Twitter for years,
        primarily lurking and reading other people’s tweets, before
        making a conscious effort to start tweeting myself, even though
        I enjoyed being on Twitter. The issue — as I have to admit,
        somewhat embarrassingly — simply boiled down to a lack of
        confidence. For some reason, I was afraid of how people online,
        especially those I looked up to professionally, would perceive
        me. In retrospect, these worries were somewhat silly and proved
        to be totally unfounded. I started tweeting occasionally about a
        year ago, and, to no surprise, my presence went largely
        unnoticed. I expect the same for sharing my work and thoughts
        online.</p>
        <h2 id="why-i-write">Why I write</h2>
        <p>Having addressed past reservations about why I refrained from
        sharing more of myself online, the question, what exactly
        motivates me to do so now, remains. This second question proved
        to be more challenging than I thought at first. I believe the
        reason is somewhat twofold and, in many ways, resembles what
        Julia Evans highlighted as the <a
        href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">primary
        motivations</a> behind her year-long blogging activity.</p>
        <p>Firstly, I am convinced that putting your thoughts in writing
        forces you to clarify and organize them in a way that perhaps
        only conversations with other people do. In the process, I often
        find myself realizing that something I previously believed I had
        a solid understanding of was, in fact, not as clear as I
        initially thought. This applies as much to academic as to
        personal reflections. Thus, I hope that writing about my
        interesting technicalities in particular will help me become a
        better software engineer, and that writing about everything else
        will help me gain a better understanding of myself and the world
        around me.</p>
        <p>Secondly, I write to get to know interesting people. I have
        already made acquaintances living on the other side of the world
        just by reaching out to them via Twitter. I sincerely hope the
        same holds true for publishing my writing on here.</p>
