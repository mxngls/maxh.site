title: My 30 under 30
subtitle: Some things I learned during the last thirty years.

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
	Some of these I wish I got to know earlier. Others I somehow knew inherently or they came to me
	naturally. And some I still struggle with today.

<ol class="wide-list">
	<li>
		Don't go to the gym. Do literally any other form of exercise instead. Your body is made to be functional and is
		capable of incredible things. Good looks will follow.
	</li>

	<li>
		Eat slowly and try to actively perceive and appreciate what you eat.
	</li>

	<li>
		Get as much exposure to the world as you can. If possible transcend the virtual and
		embrace the physical. These two are of course not mutually exclusive.
	</li>

	<li>
		Never dismiss your feelings. Nothing in the world speaks more truth.
	</li>

	<li>
		It's okay to be afraid, but try to be brave instead. It gets easier every time.
	</li>

	<li>
		Exploration is not the same as distraction. Be honest with yourself which is which.
	</li>

	<li>
		Be decisive and don't waver. In the end nothing matters anyway.
	</li>

	<li>
		<u>Everything</u> matters. Nihilism may be en vogue at times, but it's incredibly boring and
		cowardly.
	</li>

	<li>
		You can change the world. Define for yourself in which ways you would like to.
	</li>

	<li>
		Most people who try to advise caution are just afraid. You need to judge for yourself. Weigh risks and
		chances rationally.
	</li>

	<li>
		Your environment influences you in subtle and impercetible ways. So make an extra effort to choose it
		consciously.
	</li>

	<li>
		Fuck ignorant people.
	</li>

	<li>
		Stand up for yourself. No one else will or should have to.
	</li>

	<li>
		Find something creative - in the sense of bringing something into being - that you like doing. If you
		don't know what yet keep exploring (see number three). This may be the most important one.
	</li>

	<li>
		If you feel overwhelmed, depressed, anxious... (insert literally any negative emotion here)
		go outside! If you come back still feeling bad, start cleaning.
	</li>

	<li>
		Don't drink too much. If you do ask yourself why you did. It's mostly never for a good
		reason.
	</li>

	<li>
		Create, don't consume.
	</li>
</ol>
