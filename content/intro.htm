title: This Website's Reason D'etre
subtitle: Reminiscing about my motivations for creating this website.

<p>
	I took considerable time contemplating the decision to create an online
	presence for myself and share this website. Not because its development is
	technically particularly difficult, but rather due to my apprehension about
	exposing myself like this.
</p>

<h2>EXPOSING YOURSELF</h2>

<p>
	When meeting people face-to-face, I am quite outgoing, even when meeting
	them for the first time. However, this extroverted demeanor doesn’t
	seamlessly translate to my online presence. I have never felt compelled to
	share much of myself with others online. This was true during middle school
	when everyone spent their evenings chatting via ICQ, and it still holds
	today. For instance, I used Twitter for years, primarily lurking and reading
	other people’s tweets, before making a conscious effort to start tweeting
	myself, even though I enjoy being on Twitter.
</p>

<p>
	The issue – as I have to admit, somewhat embarrassingly – simply boils down
	to me lacking the confidence to share more about myself in a way that would
	make it available for everyone to see at all times. For some reason, I was
	afraid of how people online, especially those I looked up to professionally
	and intellectually, would perceive me. In retrospect, these worries were
	somewhat silly and proved to be unfounded. I started tweeting occasionally
	about a year ago, and, to no surprise, my presence went largely unnoticed. I
	expect the same for sharing my work and thoughts online here.

<h2>WHY I WRITE</h2>

<p>
	Having addressed past reservations about why I refrained from sharing more
	of myself online, the question of what exactly motivates me to do so now
	remains. This second question proved to be more challenging than I thought
	at first. I believe the reason is somewhat twofold and, in many ways,
	resembles what Julia Evans highlighted as the
	<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">primary motivation</a> behind
	her year-long blogging activity. First, I am convinced that putting your
	thoughts in writing forces you to clarify and organize them in a way that
	perhaps only conversations with other people do. In the process, I often
	find myself realizing that something I previously believed I had a solid
	understanding of was, in fact, not as clear to me as I initially thought.
	This applies as much to intellectual as to personal reflections. Thus, I
	hope that writing about interesting technicalities, in particular, will help
	me become a better engineer and that writing about everything else will help
	me gain a better understanding of myself and the people around me.
</p>

<p>
	Second, I write to get to know interesting people. I have already made
	acquaintances living on the other side of the world just by reaching out to
	them via Twitter. I sincerely hope to achieve the same through publishing my
	writing here.
