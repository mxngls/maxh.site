	<p>
		Hi, I'm Max. I am a software engineer based in Seoul, South Korea.
	</p>

	<p>
		I often take the opportunity to reach out to strangers to ask
		them random stuff or just let them know that I liked something
		they said, wrote, did or made. I urge you to do the same and
		just send me whatever you feel like. This goes the other way as
		well of course. If you find to disagree with something I said,
		try and change my mind.
