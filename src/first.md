I am not quite sure yet where this post will lead. I still feel
overwhelmed with the current task at head that I decided to at least start
tackling today. I am actually not really sure what the appropriate way to
upload these files is. Should I write simple Text files without any real
annotation, use Markdown and then compile to HTML or just write these
posts in HTML from the beginning? Again I feel kinda paralyzed by the
sheer endless possibilities.
