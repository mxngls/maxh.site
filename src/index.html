		Hi, I'm Max. I am currently based in Seoul, South Korea. This is my <a
			href=" https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/zine.html">public voice</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		You may reach me via
		<a href="https://twitter.com/Mxngls">Twitter</a> or
		<a href="mailto:maximilian._REMOVE_.e.@gmail.com">E-Mail</a>.
		Most of the software I made can be found on
		<a href="https://github.com/mxngls">Github</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I often take the opportunity to reach out to strangers to ask
		them random stuff or just let them know that I liked something
		they said, wrote, did or made. I urge you to do the same and
		just send me whatever you feel like. This goes the other way as
		well of course. If you find to disagree with something I said,
		try and change my mind.
