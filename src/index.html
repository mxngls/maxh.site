                Hi, I'm Max. I am currently based in Seoul, South Korea. This is
                my
                <a href="https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/zine.html"

            </p>
            <p>
                You may reach me via
                <a href="https://twitter.com/Mxngls">Twitter</a> or
                <a href="mailto:maximilian._REMOVE_.e.@gmail.com">E-Mail</a>.
                Most of the software I made can be found on
                <a href="https://github.com/mxngls">Github</a>.

                I often take the opportunity to reach out to strangers to ask
                them random stuff or just let them know that I liked something
                they said, wrote, did or made. I urge you to do the same and
                just send me whatever you feel like. This goes the other way as
                well of course. If you find to disagree with something I said,
                try and change my mind.
