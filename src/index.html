    <p>Hi, I'm Max. I am currently based in Seoul, South Korea. This is my <a
            href="https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/zine.html">public voice</a>.
    </p>
    <p>You may reach me via <a href="https://twitter.com/Mxngls">Twitter</a> or <a
            href="mailto:maximilian._REMOVE_.e.@gmail.com">E-Mail</a>.
        <!-- Though I constantly think about migrating to something not that proprietary... -->
        Most of the software I made can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mxngls">Github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I often take the opportunity to reach out to strangers to ask them
        random stuff or just let them know that I liked something they
        said, wrote, did or made. I urge you to do the same and just
        send me what ever you feel like. This goes the other way as well
        of course. If you find to disagree with something I said, try
        and change my mind.
    </p>
