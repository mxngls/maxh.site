Hi I'm Max. I am currently based in Seoul, South Korea. This functions
as my [public
voice](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/zine.html). Some of the
software I wrote can be found on [Github](https://github.com/mxngls).

If you would like to reach me your best bet might be simply sending me a
Twitter DM at [@mxngls](https://twitter.com/Mxngls) or leaving a mail at
[my *full* name].[the second vowel of the latin alphabet].[the German
word for honey without its umlaut]@[name of the most popular search
engine].com
