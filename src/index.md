Hi I'm Max. I am currently based in Seoul, South Korea. This site functions
as my [public voice](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/zine.html). 
Some of the software I wrote can be found on [Github](https://github.com/mxngls).
If you would like to reach me your best bet might be simply sending me a
Twitter DM at [@mxngls](https://twitter.com/Mxngls) or leaving a mail
at: `maximilian` `e` `hoenig` `gmail` `com`
