Hi I'm Max. 

My current full-time job resolves around churning out React components
and deploying stuff to AWS working for a Korean startup in Seoul. After
work, I enjoy learning about systems programming and the history of
computing.

I really like reading technical versed, independently hosted blogs.
After pondering for some time if I should start writing and publishing
stuff online myself, I decided to get this website up and running and
just give it a try.

Some of the software I wrote can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/mxngls).

If you would like to reach me your best bet might be simply sending me
a Twitter DM at [@mxngls](https://twitter.com/Mxngls) or leaving a mail
at `[my *full* name].[the second vowel of the latin alphabet].[the
German word for honey without its umlaut]@[name of the most popular
search engine].com`.
