Hi I'm Max. 

My current full-time job resolves around churning out React components
and deploying stuff to AWS working for a Korean startup in Seoul. After
work, I enjoy learning about systems programming and the history of
computing.

I really like reading independently hosted blogs. After pondering for
some time if I should start writing and publishing stuff online myself,
I decided to get this website up and running and just give it a try. You
can read more about this decision [here](why_and_why_not.html).

Some of the software I wrote can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/mxngls).

If you would like to reach me your best bet might be simply sending me a
Twitter DM at [@mxngls](https://twitter.com/Mxngls) or leaving a mail at
`[my *full* name].[the second vowel of the latin alphabet].[the German
word for honey without its umlaut]@[name of the most popular search
engine].com`.
